# Congratulations!

You have discovered the personal webpage of Naomi Saphra!

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [NYU CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) with [Kyunghyun Cho](https://kyunghyuncho.me/) and consulting part time at [MosaicML](https://www.mosaicml.com/).
My interests relate to NLP learning dynamics: how models learn to encode linguistic patterns or other structure, and how we can encode useful inductive biases into the training process. Previously, I earned a PhD from the University of Edinburgh on [Training Dynamics of Neural Language Models](https://nsaphra.github.io/files/thesis.pdf), worked at Google and Facebook, and attended Johns Hopkins and Carnegie Mellon University. Outside of research, I play roller derby under the name [Gaussian Retribution](https://auldreekierollerderby.com/2019/08/10/the-one-gift-i-received-along-with-my-disability/), do [standup comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzNDdS-lcqM), and shepherd disabled programmers into the world of [code dictation](http://nsaphra.github.io/post/hands/).

I am currently on the academic job market. Please reach out if you think I might be a good fit!
